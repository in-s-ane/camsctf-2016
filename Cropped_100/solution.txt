Last year's Cropped challenge was solvable by running `exiftool` on the jpg, but we can't really do that for this one.
Considering the name of the challenge and that noone solved the problem the way it was intended last year, it's clear
that we need to 'uncrop' the image. This reminded me heavily of another CTF problem, https://github.com/ctfs/write-ups-2013/tree/master/csaw-quals-2013/misc/deeeeeeaaaaaadbeeeeeeeeeef-200
but we are dealing with a jpg, not png.

The bytes detailing the size of the jpg were obviously modified, and we need to find those bytes and increase them.

As per the article, we find that the bytes we want to modify are
01 C2 01 82

Since the picture tells us that the flag is just below, let's increase the height of
the image, changing the above to
02 C2 01 82

The code for modifying the size can be found in resize.py

Open the resized image to find the flag:

{MS_paint_is_lyfe_MS_paint_4ever}
