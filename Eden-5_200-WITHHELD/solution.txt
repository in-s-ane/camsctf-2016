Going into Eden's messages, we find a message from Nobias that contains "nobiaspersonal.html".
This looks out of place, so maybe it's a page on the NO. CO. website?

It appears to be empty, but in reality there is a comment of interest.

Following the link gives us a download containing Android vmdk files. If we open it up in VMWare,
we can view the contents of the device.

Bruce's phone is pretty cool, since it has root access, so let's hop into terminal and see what
we can do.

Going to his home directory, we find a suspicious folder called my_passwords.
Going into the directory and listing all files, we find a .pass.txt file containing his password.
