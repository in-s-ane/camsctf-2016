Logging into the cscbook website with Eden Sterling's credentials, we find that we now have access to a lot more stuff.

Going to Eden Sterling's profile page, we find a website listed:
Website: http://nobiascorp.camscsc.org

Visiting the website, we find that we are not using the "right" browser. Looking at the source, we find a comment:
<!-- User Agent != nobiasbrowser -->

If we change our useragent to "nobiasbrowser", we are led to a login page at
http://nobiascorp.camscsc.org/waieopbhd.php

Located in the source of this page is a seemingly base64 encoded string.
<!-- 0FBN3jxrz6dfb4Kkh/n6hA== -->

However, when we decode it, we don't get anything that resembles a password. Playing around with the string
revealed that encoding it in hex made it look an awful lot like a hash.

The hash is actually an md4 hash, which we can crack using an online tool:
