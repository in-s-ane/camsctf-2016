Looking at the source reveals the following javascript code:

var a = "b";var b = "a";function bar( barr ){return barr( barr ) + a + b + c + barr( barr );}function barr(){return "k";}var c = "r";

If we look at the bar function, we realize that it doesn't really do anything with the
parameter, since it just adds the values of barr(), a, b, and c together.
The barr function just returns "k", so it's pretty easy to construct the correct password: kbark

Inputting that as the password gives us the flag.
