Looking at the source reveals the following:

var a = "b";var b = "a";function bar( barr ){return barr( barr ) + a + b + c + barr( barr );}function barr(){return "k";}var c = "r";

If we look at the bar function, we realize that it doesn't really do anything with the parameter, just adding barr(), a, b, and c together.

Looking at the values of the variables, it's pretty easy to construct the correct password: kbark

Inputting that as the password gives us the flag.

{variables_n_functionz}
