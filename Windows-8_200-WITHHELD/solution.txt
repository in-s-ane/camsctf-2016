After solving Windows 2, Windows 8 becomes trivial, since we are able to easily transfer files
between the vm and the host. Booting into safe mode and clicking on the hint for Administrator
reveals that we need to brute force the password.

Using shared folders with VirtualBox, I was able to transfer pwdump onto the vm and dump the passwords.

After sharing my folder containing pwdump, I ran it and captured the output into passwords.txt.
Since we only care about the Administrator's password, we can just remove the rest of the passwords.
