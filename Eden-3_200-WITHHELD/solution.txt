Looking at Eden Sterling's profile on the cscbook page, we find that his username is stringsinCsharp.
http://cscbook.camscsc.org/profile/stringsinCsharp

However, the password is hidden in the Eden_Drive somewhere.
A previous hint on the home page tell us to check for deleted files, which we can do using testdisk or photorec.

Trying to extract lost files using `testdisk` reveals 5 files, with one of them being a pdf. However, when I tried to
extract text from the pdf using `pdftotext`, I found the username (which was already known), but the password was a bunch of
unicode. Searching online, I found a tool called PDF Extract, which can be found at http://www.pdf-tools.com/pdf/pdf-extract-content-metadata-text.aspx.

If we download the shell version and run it on the pdf, we extract rest of text, including the password.
With this information, we can construct the flag.
