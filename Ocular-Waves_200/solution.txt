Running `file` on the file reveals that the first file is a kgb archive, so we can just run
`kgb time` to decompress it.

Successfully decompressing the archive reveals another sfArk archive, which we can extract via
sfarkxtc (https://github.com/raboof/sfarkxtc).

This finally reveals a sound file, which we can import as raw data in audacity.
At a glance, all it seems to be saying is "aint nobody got time", but there's a tiny part that really stands out.
We can extract that data into another file (see extracted.wav).

Opening up the wav file in spek (yay neoctf), we see the flag.
