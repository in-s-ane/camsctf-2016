Looking at the picture in Stegsolve revealed that there are pixels in the top left corner of the picture
that are not truly white. However, when we try extracting that data hidden within the red, green, and
blue planes, Stegsolve bugs out when we try exporting this data, and I couldn't get it to work
with PIL, so I resorted to downloading and installing zsteg.

Running zsteg on the picture reveals the flag.
