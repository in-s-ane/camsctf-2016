Logging into the NO. CO website, we find a hidden link:
<a href="Files.zip" rel="/files">Files.zip</a>

Ignoring Files.zip (for now), if we go to /files, we find one file called transactions.xlsx.
Eden 8 is about finding the oldest transaction, so clearly this is relevant.
http://nobiascorp.camscsc.org/files/transactions.xlsx

Downloading and opening the file reveals that there are a ton of characters and will make libreoffice
not respond. Unzipping the file and looking at the xml shows that a theme is being loaded, which
we want to remove.

We can remove the theme from the file by doing the following:

$ unzip transactions.xlsx
$ rm xl/theme/theme1.xml
$ zip -r repaired.xlsx *

Opening repaired.xlsx will show the transactions between NO. CO. and its clients.
All we need to do now is pick the earliest date.
