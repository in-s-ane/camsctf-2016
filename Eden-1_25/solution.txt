There is a post that says:

Hello CCTF Competitors.
My name is Mack Millan and I am the lead forensics investigator in the case of
Eden Sterling. You must have heard the tragic suicide of Eden Sterling by now.
He was found dead outside of his house. From what my team could recover, it
appears that Eden climbed onto the roof of his three story house and jumped at
night. I understand that the whole situation is very unsettling. If you didn't
know, Eden was a really talented programmer at Hacker High School. He always had
the top scores in his class. However, earlier today, my team received an
anonymous tip-off email with a suspiciously large PDF attachment. We were
explicitly told to not open the attachment and to pass the attachment onto your
team. You probably know that my team is composed of biology and chemistry major
graduates. We are clueless when it comes to digital forensics and it appears
that this investigation will now need to go digital. I cannot provide you with
much to start your investigation, considering that the censorious principal of
Hacker High School does not want us to question the students too much and that
Eden's parents would not permit further analysis of his personal items (laptops,
cell phones, etc.). All we have is the suspicious attachment.
Good luck, and be careful.
