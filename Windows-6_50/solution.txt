Upon logging into Data Storage's account, we are greeted with a shutdown message.
Going into Run>msconfig>startup, we find two suspicious programs being run on startup:
shutdown.bat.bat and flag.txt.

If we disable shutdown.bat.bat, we prevent the system from shutting down upon logging in, and
opening flag.txt reveals the flag.
