Looking at some of these posts, we find one by Alice:
Hey all, I've created a website like Pinterest. You guys should totally check it out and post stuff! http://cscpin.camscsc.org

Following the link reveals a website quite similar to Pinterest. Looking back at one of the hints that
tells us that all favicons are suspicious, we find string of text hidden within:

no one will ever look here. http://camscsc.org/dl.php?key=dU6Fzx3RaBbNr8yLIuPl

Logging in shows that we need a password though, so it looks like we need to do a bit more work.

Scrolling through the photos reveals a picture of the Ubuntu logo along with some strange text:

Yncgbc: S6It7fkTHXu9lO

Performing rot-13 on this string will give us the decrypted message:
Laptop: F6Vg7sxGUKh9yB

{F6Vg7sxGUKh9yB}
