The problem asks us to find the flag on the administrator's desktop, which is pretty straightforward.
However, even though Data_Storage is an administrator account, we can't view Administrator's files, but
we can change the administrator's password.

>> net user Administrator abc123
The command completed successfully.

Now, we can click Start>All Programs>Accessories>Command Prompt>Run as administrator, and
view C:\Documents and Settings\Administrator\Desktop\finalflag.txt
